## Problem Statement
Evaluating individual player contributions in the Premier League is complex due to the limitations of traditional metrics. Goals and assists alone may not reflect deeper player impact or efficiency. This project seeks to analyze performance data for the 2019/2020 season using structured analysis in Excel. It aims to:
- Identify top-performing players by goals, assists, and shots taken
- Examine team-wide offensive efficiency
- Discover performance trends across positions and teams
- Provide clear, actionable insights for decision-makers in football

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Collection** - Imported raw data into Microsoft Excel from Kaggle, covering player stats for the 2019â€“2020 season.
2. **Pre-Analysis Planning** - Defined dependent (e.g., goals, assists) and independent (e.g., team, position) variables. Drafted analysis questions such as:
   - Who scored the most goals?
   - How do assists relate to team success?
   - Which teams contributed most to offensive metrics?
3. **Data Cleaning**
     - Converted data into Excel Tables
     - Removed duplicates, corrected naming inconsistencies
     - Standardized team and player names, handled missing values
4. **Exploratory Analysis**  
   - Created pivot tables to group data by team and player
   - Filtered stats across positions, clubs, and metrics
5. **Visualization**  
   - Built bar, pie, and line charts for goals, assists, shots, and team contributions
   - Designed a clean and interactive dashboard using Excel slicers

### Key Insights:
- Kevin De Bruyne had the highest goal contributions (33: 13 goals, 20 assists) in the season.
- Mohamed Salah led the league in shots taken (95), followed closely by Gabriel Jesus (89).
- Manchester City scored the most goals (100) and tied with Liverpool in assists (69).
- Jamie Vardy was the top goal scorer with 23 goals, followed by Ings and Aubameyang (22).
- Assists and goals strongly correlate â€” teams with high assists tend to have high goals.
- Teams like Leicester City and Chelsea had comparable assists but varied goal outputs, suggesting differing striker efficiencies.
- Midfield creativity and structured team play drive attacking success more than individual brilliance alone.
